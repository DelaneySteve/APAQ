# APAQ (AirPort Air Quality) Predictor
The AirPort Air Quality (APAQ) Predictor is an API tool that can be used to predict the air quality (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 microns, PM10) in the area near an airport from an aerial image (synthetic or real) of the airport alone.

## Quick Setup
1. Create a virtual environment by executing `make` in the root.
2. Activate the virtual environment by executing `. venv/Scripts/activate` (for Windows) or `. venv/bin/activate` (for Mac/Linux) also in the root directory.
3. Run the program by executing `make run` in the root directory.
